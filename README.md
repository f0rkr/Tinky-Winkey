This project will get you to broaden your knowledge in the Windows Operating system. By making a Service and Keylogger:
  - Windows services are program that operate in background. They are often managed
by the Service Control Manager. Services interact with the SCM through the
Windows API or Windows service management tools such as sc.exe.
note: terminating sc.exe is used as a method of causing the Blue Screen of Death.
  
     ```sc.exe [<servername>] [<command>] [<servicename>] [<option1>] [<option2>] ...```

  - Keyloggers are programs that track the activities of a keyboard. Keyloggers are a
form of spyware where users are unaware their actions are being tracked. Keyloggers
can be used for a variety of purposes; hackers may use them to maliciously gain
access to your private information, while employers might use them to monitor
employee activities.
